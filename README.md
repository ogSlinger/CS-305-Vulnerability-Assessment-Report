# CS-305-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

The client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for the customers. Their software requirements were to use the most current and effective software security. They had a 
RESTful web API, and they wished to protect their organization from external threats.

**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**

I found running the static test was a very straight forward process, however, identifying each vulnerability and understanding them was a bit of a challenge. It is important to code securely to disallow access to data 
that may be harmful if leaked to unauthorized users or hackers. For a company like Artemis Financial, a security threat may slow or even halt operations of a business location. The company may leak data to attackers due 
to not using the best practices in software security, which may put them at legal risk. Also, controlling data access and having proper logging could help prevent malicious intent from employees form within the company.

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

I found that learning about OWASP and static testing was a huge learning point for myself. It gave me insights on how software security is handled on a global scale, and made me realize there are organizations who actively 
seek out and remedy security threats from other software company libraries and frameworks.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

Utilizing the Vulnerability Assessment Flow Chart provided by the class helped in understanding how to apply security at crucial parts of the program. I could use it also in design choices on starting a project that may involve 
communications over the internet. Then, using a static testing tool and OWASP can further identify security threats. These threats can then be looked up at OWASP to see what exactly the type of attack the vulnerability poses, and 
appropriate design choices can be made when structuring the program.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

Whenever new code gets added, or dependencies get updated, another static test should be made again. Also, if the code that gets implemented is new, the Vulnerability Assessment Flow Chart should be utilized again as well.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

The OWASP static test tool for Java, and the website itself, is probably the best two resources for security vulnerability assessments. 

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

From this assignment, I would say that I can show that I demonstrated the basic skills when it comes to risk assessment in software security. I can show that I have the knowledge of OWASP, utiliziing it's static testing tool, 
and understanding how to remedy some of the vulnerabilities through the reporting presented in the report.
